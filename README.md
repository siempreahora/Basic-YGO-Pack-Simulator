# Basic-YGO-Pack-Simulator

One of my very old Python files, originally made in Replit.com. I made this code to test my knowledge of Python at the time, specifically random generation and saving text in a .TXT file. I decided to make a basic Yugioh card pack store (since I love that game), using both actual cards and customs someone other than I made. (If you know the OCG/TCG, you should know which cards are real and which ones are customs.)

This project also includes one of the very early iterations of one of my favorite custom modules I made: The RPG_Dialogue_Mods file. I have since improved that file tenfold, but its nice to have one of the earlier versions to show how far it came.

Just run the main.py file, and enjoy the simple fun (if clunky) simulator, it should hopefully work. (If it doesn't work, then its likely Replit.com was the one making the project work.)

If you're curious who made the customs, here's a link to their custom Yugioh blog that holds all the archetypes and decks they made:
